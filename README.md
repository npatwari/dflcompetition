## The Bosch Device-Free Localization Competition

The Bosch Device-Free Localization (DFL) Competition will **not** be held at CPS-IoT Week in 2019.  We have cancelled this year's competition.  We are planning for a future competition, and we will post plans here at [dflcompetition.org](https://dflcompetition.org) when we have more information.
